# Task Allocation using Auctions
Dynamic decentralized task allocation algorithms for multi-agent systems using a greedy auction algorithm.

Master's research at The University of Texas at Austin in the research group of Efstathios Bakolas.

The paper resulting from these simulations has been published at the Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC 2021).

* For the dynamic task allocation, run `OptimalControl_DTA.m`.
* For the sensitivity analysis of the parameters, run `optimalControlParametersAnalysis.m`.
