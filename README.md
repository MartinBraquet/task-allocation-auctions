# Task Allocation using Auctions
Dynamic decentralized task allocation algorithms for multi-agent systems using auctions and machine learning.

Master's research at The University of Texas at Austin in the research group of Efstathios Bakolas.

A paper resulting from these simulations is expected to be published around February 2021.

* For the dynamic task allocation, run `OptimalControl_DTA.m`.
* For the sensitivity analysis of the parameters, run `optimalControlParametersAnalysis.m`.

Note: this repository is actively in progress and needs to be cleaned in the near future.
